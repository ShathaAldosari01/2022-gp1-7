# gp1_7_2022 / Odyssey 

Odyssey is a platform for tourism that allows people to get a sense of place, plan their trip, decide where to go, and can keep accessing the app wherever they go all under the same roof, is much more beneficial than going to a place unaware of the poor reviews or not knowing where to start exploring or not keeping track of the places to visit when they wish to visit that city later.

For a traveler who faces difficulties finding places/activities to experience, people with similar interests to follow, and feels overwhelmed when planning for a trip, the Odyssey is a social network platform designed for travelers that will help them create lists to plan upcoming trips and discover new places. Odyssey will make sure that users can look at other usersâ€™ suggested lists that are similar to them so they might want to try something they're interested in.

The purpose of this platform is for travellers to share their adventures so that others who are lost and don't know where to go can get ideas from others and inspiration from them.
