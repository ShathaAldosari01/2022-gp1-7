# ✈️ About Odyssey
For a traveler who faces difficulties finding places/activities to experience, people with similar interests to follow, and feels overwhelmed when planning for a trip, the Odyssey is a social network platform designed for travelers that will help them create lists to plan upcoming trips and discover new places all under the same roof. Odyssey will make sure that users can look at other users’ suggested lists that are similar to them so they might want to try something they're interested in.
