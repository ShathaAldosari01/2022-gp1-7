Odyssey is a platform for tourism that allows people to get a sense of place, plan their trip, decide where to go, and can keep accessing the app wherever they go all under the same roof, is much more beneficial than going to a place unaware of the poor reviews or not knowing where to start exploring or not keeping track of the places to visit when they wish to visit that city later. Tourism apps will enable many local and global businesses to shine to the outside world. Individuals from outside the city might be intrigued to visit the city after they have discovered it through the application.

It's a social media application made by flutter and fire base created by student of king saud university for their graduation project.
